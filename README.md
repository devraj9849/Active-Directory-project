<h1>Active-Directory-project</h1>

Active Directory (AD) is a database and set of services that connect users with the network resources they need to get their work done. The database (or directory) contains critical information about your environment, including what users and computers there are and whoâ€™s allowed to do what. its purpose is to enable IT departments to create and manage user accounts and control access to resources on corporate networks. With it, admins can create and enforce security policies for the network.

After this we can create any new user For example BOB and also a group admin user on the active directory. We can see those in the event viewer as:

Event ID: 4720: User account created

Event ID: 4726: User account deleted

Event ID: 4727: Creation of security enabled group

So if we have Splunk or any SIEM installed, then we can see all the user that we created, or deleted or any other things that are happening in the system, we can see there or also in Event Viewer.
